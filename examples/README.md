# Examples

This folder contains example runs of the Jupyter notebooks. The examples are based on the sample data in the `data/` folder in this repository. The examples are:

- Train a VAE on a range of different GHG emission scenarios: [`VAEp_train.ipynb`](VAEp_train.md)

- Use the VAE to make predictions on new GHG emission scenarios: [`VAEp_explore.ipynb`](VAEp_explore.md)
